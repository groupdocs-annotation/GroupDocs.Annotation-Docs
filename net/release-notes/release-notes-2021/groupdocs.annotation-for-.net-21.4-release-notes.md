## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

1. During the complete code simplifying and refactoring, namespaces for the public API were changed. Therefore, since 21.4 the [License](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/groupdocs.annotation.licenses/license) and [Metered](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/groupdocs.annotation.licenses/metered) classes, which were previously located in [GroupDocs.Annotation](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/groupdocs.annotation) namespace, have been moved to a separate namespace [GroupDocs.Annotation.Licenses](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/groupdocs.annotation.licenses).
