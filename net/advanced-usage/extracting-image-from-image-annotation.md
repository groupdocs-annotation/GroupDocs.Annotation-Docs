You can extract an image from the [ImageAnnotation](https://reference.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/groupdocs.annotation.models.annotationmodels/imageannotation/) object. To do this, call the [ImageAnnotation.GetImage()](https://reference.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/groupdocs.annotation.models.annotationmodels/imageannotation/methods/getimage) method.

The following code snippet shows how to extract an image from an image annotation:

{{< tabs "example1">}}
{{< tab "C#" >}}
```csharp
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator("annotated_file.docx"))
{
	List<AnnotationBase> annotations = annotator.Get();
	for (int i = 0; i < annotations.Count; i++)
	{
		if (annotations[i] is ImageAnnotation imageAnnotation)
		{
			Image image = imageAnnotation.GetImage();
			image.Save($"extracted_image{i + 1}.{imageAnnotation.ImageExtension}");
		}
	}
}
```
