## What is a document component?

**Component** is a textual or graphic notes, comments and remarks attached to a specific part of a document content - sections, paragraphs, sentences or even words. So, the components are basically the same as the annotations

The main difference between components and annotations is that components are specific to each format. That means you cannot apply pdf component to word, image, or diagram document etc.

### Add component to the document

**[GroupDocs.Annotation](https://products.groupdocs.com/annotation/net)** along with annotations allows to apply components. Supported components list is described in a table below. 

### List of supported components

<table border="1">
 <tr>
    <td colspan="2" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;"><b style="font-size:18px">Components for PDF documents</b></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
    <td><a href="annotation/net/add-dropdown-component">Dropdown</a></td>
    <td>Dropdown component that can be applied in random place on document page. More conventional name for dropdown component is <i>combo box.</i></td>
 </tr>
