## What is a document component?

Component is a text or graphic note, comment and remark attached to a specific part of the document content - section, paragraph, sentence, or words.

The main difference between components and annotations is that components are specific to the file format. That means you cannot apply a PDF component to Word, Image, or diagram file, etc.
